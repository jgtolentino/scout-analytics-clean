# Scout Dashboard Data Storytelling Guidelines

> Transform data into decisions, not decorations.

## üéØ Core Principle: Start with the "So What?"

Every chart, metric, and insight should answer a specific business question. If viewers need to ask "So what does this mean?", we've failed.

## The Scout Storytelling Framework

### 1. **Context ‚Üí Insight ‚Üí Action**

Every dashboard view should follow this narrative arc:

```
üìç Context: "Here's what happened" (the data)
üí° Insight: "Here's why it matters" (the interpretation)
üéØ Action: "Here's what to do next" (the recommendation)
```

### 2. **Progressive Disclosure**

Structure information hierarchically:

```
Level 1: Executive Summary (3-5 key metrics)
    ‚Üì
Level 2: Category Breakdown (department/product views)
    ‚Üì
Level 3: Deep Dive Analysis (time series, correlations)
    ‚Üì
Level 4: Raw Data Explorer (for analysts)
```

### 3. **The 10-Second Rule**

A decision-maker should understand the main message within 10 seconds. Test every chart against this rule.

## Chart Selection Guide

### Match the Chart to the Question

| Question Type | Best Chart | Why | Example |
|--------------|------------|-----|---------|
| **What's the trend?** | Line chart | Shows change over time clearly | Monthly revenue |
| **How do parts compare?** | Bar chart | Easy magnitude comparison | Sales by region |
| **What's the distribution?** | Box plot / Histogram | Shows spread and outliers | Customer age ranges |
| **How are things related?** | Scatter plot | Reveals correlations | Price vs. demand |
| **What's the flow?** | Sankey diagram | Shows movement between states | Customer journey |
| **What's the composition?** | Stacked bar / Treemap | Part-to-whole relationships | Product mix |
| **Where are the hotspots?** | Heatmap / Choropleth | Geographic or matrix patterns | Store performance map |

### Charts to Avoid (and Why)

‚ùå **Pie Charts**: Hard to compare slices accurately  
‚úÖ **Instead use**: Horizontal bar chart

‚ùå **3D Charts**: Distort data perception  
‚úÖ **Instead use**: 2D alternatives

‚ùå **Dual Y-Axis**: Confuses scale interpretation  
‚úÖ **Instead use**: Small multiples or indexed values

---

## Visual Encoding Best Practices

### 1. **Color with Purpose**

```scss
// Scout Color Palette
$insight-red: #E74C3C;      // Negative changes, alerts
$insight-green: #27AE60;    // Positive changes, success
$neutral-gray: #7F8C8D;     // Baseline, context
$focus-blue: #3498DB;       // Selected, highlighted
$ai-purple: #9B59B6;        // AI-generated insights
```

**Rules:**
- Use color to highlight, not decorate
- Maximum 5-7 colors per view
- Ensure colorblind accessibility
- Consistent meaning across dashboards

### 2. **Typography Hierarchy**

```css
.chart-title {
  font-size: 18px;
  font-weight: 600;
  /* Make it a complete sentence */
  /* ‚ùå "Revenue" */
  /* ‚úÖ "Revenue declined 12% in Q4 due to seasonality" */
}

.metric-value {
  font-size: 32px;
  font-weight: 700;
}

.metric-change {
  font-size: 14px;
  color: var(--change-color);
  /* Always show direction: ‚Üë +12% or ‚Üì -8% */
}
```

### 3. **Consistent Scales**

- Always start bar charts at zero
- Use log scale only when necessary (label it clearly)
- Keep time axes consistent across charts
- Round numbers for readability (1.2K not 1,234)

---

## Audience-First Design

### Executive View
```typescript
interface ExecutiveView {
  metrics: ['revenue', 'profit_margin', 'customer_satisfaction'];
  timeframe: 'last_30_days';
  comparisons: 'vs_last_period';
  insights: 'top_3_only';
  details: 'hidden_by_default';
}
```

**Characteristics:**
- Big numbers with trend arrows
- Exception-based reporting (only show problems)
- Mobile-optimized layout
- One-click export to presentation

### Manager View
```typescript
interface ManagerView {
  metrics: ['team_performance', 'budget_variance', 'project_status'];
  timeframe: 'current_quarter';
  breakdowns: ['by_team', 'by_project'];
  insights: 'actionable_recommendations';
  interactivity: 'drill_down_enabled';
}
```

**Characteristics:**
- Comparative analysis
- Resource allocation views
- Performance tracking
- Team-level filters

### Analyst View
```typescript
interface AnalystView {
  metrics: 'all_available';
  timeframe: 'custom_range';
  tools: ['pivot', 'export', 'sql_query'];
  insights: 'statistical_analysis';
  raw_data: 'accessible';
}
```

**Characteristics:**
- Full interactivity
- Custom calculations
- Raw data access
- Advanced filtering

## AI Integration for Narratives

### 1. **Automated Insight Generation**

Every chart should have an AI-powered "Explain This" option:

```typescript
interface AIInsightRequest {
  chartType: string;
  data: ChartData;
  context: {
    filters: FilterState;
    timeRange: DateRange;
    previousPeriod?: ChartData;
  };
  audience: 'executive' | 'manager' | 'analyst';
}

// Example output
{
  headline: "Sales dropped 15% after promotional period ended",
  explanation: "The decline from $1.2M to $1.02M coincided with the end of the Summer Sale campaign on July 15th.",
  recommendation: "Consider extending promotional periods or implementing loyalty programs to maintain momentum.",
  confidence: 0.87
}
```

### 2. **Natural Language Summaries**

Replace generic titles with AI-generated headlines:

```typescript
// ‚ùå Bad: Generic title
<ChartTitle>Monthly Revenue</ChartTitle>

// ‚úÖ Good: Narrative title
<ChartTitle>
  {aiGeneratedHeadline || "Revenue grew 12% in October, driven by new product launch"}
</ChartTitle>
```

### 3. **Contextual Explanations**

```typescript
const ExplainButton = () => {
  const [explanation, setExplanation] = useState(null);
  
  const handleExplain = async () => {
    const context = gatherChartContext();
    const aiResponse = await suqiAI.explainChart(context);
    setExplanation(aiResponse);
  };
  
  return (
    <>
      <Button icon="üß†" onClick={handleExplain}>
        Explain This
      </Button>
      {explanation && (
        <InsightCard>
          <h4>{explanation.headline}</h4>
          <p>{explanation.narrative}</p>
          <ActionItems items={explanation.recommendations} />
        </InsightCard>
      )}
    </>
  );
};
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå Mistake #1: Data Dump Dashboard
**Problem**: Showing all available data without hierarchy  
**Solution**: Start with 3-5 key metrics, allow drill-down

### ‚ùå Mistake #2: Chartjunk
**Problem**: Unnecessary 3D effects, gradients, decorations  
**Solution**: Flat design, meaningful color only

### ‚ùå Mistake #3: Missing Context
**Problem**: Numbers without comparison or benchmarks  
**Solution**: Always show vs. last period, target, or industry average

### ‚ùå Mistake #4: Unclear Actions
**Problem**: Insights without recommendations  
**Solution**: Every insight should suggest next steps

### ‚ùå Mistake #5: One-Size-Fits-All
**Problem**: Same view for all users  
**Solution**: Role-based dashboards with appropriate detail levels
