# PulseEdit: MCP-Powered Replit-like Environment

## Overview

PulseEdit leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture to create a Replit-like development environment with:

1. **Code editing** with syntax highlighting and auto-completion
2. **Multi-language support** (JavaScript, Python, HTML/CSS)
3. **Live preview** for web projects
4. **Real-time execution** in a sandboxed environment
5. **File system operations** (create, read, update, delete)
6. **Terminal integration**
7. **Claude AI assistance** for code help and suggestions

## Architecture Extension

To implement this, we'll extend our existing MCP architecture:

### 1. New MCP Bridges

- **VSCode Bridge**: Already implemented, provides code editing functionality
- **Node.js Execution Bridge**: For running JavaScript/Node.js code
- **Python Execution Bridge**: For running Python code
- **Sandbox Container Bridge**: For isolated code execution
- **Terminal Bridge**: For command execution in a controlled environment

### 2. Extended Routing

Add new routing rules for code execution and development tasks:

```yaml
# Code execution routes
- intent: "run javascript code"
  agent: "Surf"
  target: "node_execution"
  bridge: "node_execution_bridge"
  priority: "high"
  context: ["run", "execute", "javascript", "node", "npm"]
  filetypes: [".js", ".jsx", ".ts", ".tsx"]
  fallback: "Claude"

- intent: "run python code"
  agent: "Surf"
  target: "python_execution"
  bridge: "python_execution_bridge"
  priority: "high"
  context: ["run", "execute", "python", "script", "pip"]
  filetypes: [".py", ".ipynb"]
  fallback: "Claude"

- intent: "preview web application"
  agent: "Edge"
  target: "web_preview"
  bridge: "web_preview_bridge"
  priority: "high"
  context: ["preview", "web", "html", "css", "browser", "render"]
  filetypes: [".html", ".css", ".js"]
  fallback: "Claude"
```

### 3. Web UI Components

- **Editor Component**: Monaco Editor (same as VS Code) for code editing
- **File Explorer Component**: For navigating project files
- **Terminal Component**: For command execution
- **Preview Component**: For viewing web applications
- **Output Component**: For viewing code execution results
- **Package Manager UI**: For installing dependencies
- **Collaboration Tools**: For multi-user editing

## Implementation Approach

1. **Core MCP System**: Already implemented (server, routing, bridges)
2. **Execution Sandbox**: Use Docker containers for isolated execution
3. **Web Frontend**: Extend the current webapp with Monaco Editor and Xterm.js
4. **Persistence Layer**: Add file system API to save projects
5. **Authentication**: Add user accounts and project management
6. **AI Integration**: Integrate Claude for code assistance

## Security Considerations

1. **Code Execution Isolation**: All code runs in Docker containers
2. **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, and time limits for executions
3. **Network Access Control**: Limited or no network access from execution environments
4. **File System Isolation**: Projects are isolated from each other
5. **Input Validation**: All commands and code are validated before execution

## User Experience

1. User creates a new project and selects a template or starts from scratch
2. MCP manages file editing, execution, and previewing
3. Claude integrates throughout the experience to provide help:
   - Code completion and suggestions
   - Bug fixing help
   - Answering programming questions
   - Explaining code concepts
4. Projects can be shared, collaborated on, and embedded elsewhere

## Technical Components

1. **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Monaco Editor
2. **Backend**: Node.js Express server + MCP architecture
3. **Execution**: Docker containers for each language runtime
4. **Storage**: MongoDB for user data, Redis for session management
5. **Authentication**: JWT-based auth system
6. **Real-time**: WebSockets for live updates and collaboration

This concept leverages the already implemented MCP architecture to provide a complete web-based development environment similar to Replit, but with integrated AI assistance through Claude.
